Enhance Your WooCommerce Checkout with a Distance Calculator WordPress Plugin

Introduction:
For online businesses that offer delivery services, determining the cost of delivery can be a challenge. A distance calculator on the checkout page can make this process easier for both the customer and the business. That's where the Calculate Prices based on Distance For WooCommerce comes in. This WordPress plugin uses the Google Maps API to calculate the distance between two addresses and adds the cost to the total purchase price on the WooCommerce checkout page.

Features:

Distance Calculator: The plugin calculates the distance between the customer's address and the admin-defined address. This calculation is based on the selected unit (kilometer or mile) and the cost per unit set by the admin. The plugin also includes two options on the checkout page: store pickup and delivery. If the customer selects store pickup, only the date and time input will show. If the customer selects delivery, the map with the location of the admin-defined address will display.
Datepicker and Timepicker: The plugin includes a datepicker and timepicker, both of which can be easily configured on the admin side. The admin can disable specific days or times from the checkout, and there is an option to make either the datepicker or timepicker required.
Admin Side: On the admin side, the plugin provides an easy-to-use interface for setting the cost per unit, the address that will be used as the starting point for distance calculations, and the date and time settings. The plugin also requires an API key from Google Maps, which can be easily obtained. Along with the API key, the admin must enable the Maps Javascript API, Places API, GeoLocation API, Geocoding API, and Direction API to use the plugin's features.
WooCommerce Integration: The Calculate Prices based on Distance For WooCommerce integrates seamlessly with WooCommerce, adding the delivery cost to the total purchase price on the checkout page.
User-Friendly: The plugin is easy to install and set up, making it a great option for businesses of all sizes.
PRO Version:
The PRO version of the Calculate Prices based on Distance For WooCommerce includes additional features that enhance the delivery cost calculation and checkout process. The admin can hide the datepicker and timepicker on the checkout page and make either option required. Additionally, the PRO version allows the admin to set different prices based on the distance, offering even more customization options.
For Example :FROM 1KM to 10KM price should be $1 and from 10KM to 100KM price should be $2

Google Maps API Key and Billing Details:
Please note that to use the Google Maps API, the admin must enable billing details for the API key. This is a policy from Google for spam protection, and the admin will not be charged for using the API.

Conclusion:
The Calculate Prices based on Distance For WooCommerce is a must-have for online businesses that offer delivery services. Its distance calculator and WooCommerce integration make it a convenient and efficient way to determine delivery costs, saving both the business and the customer time and hassle. With the added options for the datepicker, timepicker, and delivery cost calculation, the PRO version offers even more customization options for businesses. Try it today and see how it can enhance your checkout process.
